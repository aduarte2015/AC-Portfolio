			<h1>UX Case Study: Website Redesign</h1>
			<figure class="device">

			</figure>
			<p>I was tasked by eClerx Customer Operations, a technology company that provides solutions and services to the Cable and Telecom industries, to redesign their website. 

I developed a user interface and process which allowed eClerx Customer Operations to more effectively communicate about their numerous services,  while capturing the modern technology the company has developed for some of the biggest companies in the world.</p>



<h3>The Key for Success: Understanding Clients' needs</h3>
<h4>Interviews</h4>
<p>At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted 3 user interviews with current clients and potential prospects in order to get a better understanding of what type of information they were looking for on the company's website. Though my research, users described how the current website was not very appealing, the information provided wasn't clear and they had to click and be redirected multiple times in order to find the information they were looking for.</p>

			<h4>Information Architecture</h4>
<p>In order to guide the users thought the website and enable them to successfuly interest with the product and fulfil their goals, I developed the information structure and visual hierarchy of the site, thought a detailed style guide to distinghuish size, color, contrast, alignment etc and make the information easy to navigate.</p>

			<h4>Sketches</h4>
<p>I usually start the design process with low fidelity sketches. This is the way I iterate through many design options quickly.

On this stage, I highlighted the main sections of the website and what was the key message to convey on the homepage.</p>

			<h4>Wireframes</h4>
<p>At the beginning of my design process I created wireframes for testing purposes.</p>

<h4>UI Design</h4>
<p>Once I tested out all usability mistakes, I started designing the final screens in Sketch.

I wanted to follow a modern and light visual style with illustrations and I used a 12-column grid system, since the website would be built using a Bootstrap framework.</p>

<h4>My Takeaway</h4>
<p>Since eClerx is a very traditional company, my biggest fear in this project was that senior leadership would not approve the modern look and feel of the website. I believe the biggest selling point was the structured approach to the information architecture, and also the visual design, enhanced by the use of illustrations throughout the website. </p>
