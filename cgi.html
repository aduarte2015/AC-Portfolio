			<p>I was tasked to design landing page for a creative services company that focuses on Computer Generated Image production (CGI) to clients in retail, manufacturing and luxury sectors.  The main goal of the landing page was to attract new leads and encourage them sign up to the services brochure. </p>

			<h2 >Above the Fold Section</h2>
			<p class="description">Since we wanted prospects and current clients to immediately see the potential and benefits of the CGI service, we decided to include a custom video highlighting some of the recent projects the company had created, as well as the benefits it provided to clients. I edited some of the original compositions and included animations and motions graphics to the video, which was showcase  autoplay.

			<h2 class="thoughts">Afterthoughts: How to bridge the gap between design and development?</h2>
			
			<p>Since this project was to attract clients in high fashion, retail and other luxury industries, visual design was a key element. My main issue was to engage the development team and emphasize the importance of following the pattern library created and it took many iterations to deliver the final page, with the right visual and
responsiveness. The key takeaway: Get developers involved early-Communication is key!
